> login to master server and install ansible
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install software-properties-common
    sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
    sudo apt install ansible

   
   
> login to slave server (with putty method)
> sudo apt-get update (check first if python is install then not required to install these two steps)
> install python: sudo apt-get install python

-----------now to make keyless ssh possible----------------

> now go to master server and switch into .ssh directory: cd .ssh/
> look for id_rsa.pub file and if it is not present then create one: ssh-keygen -t rsa
> run commnad: cat id_rsa.pub
> copy the code of the file.
> Now move to slave server and switch to .ssh directory: cd .ssh
> now edit authorize_key file: sudo nano authorized_keys
> paste the code inside the authorized_key file
> now you are able to connect slave server using: ssh <ip_address>

-----------adding slave into Host ---------
> edit host file of ansible by command: sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
> now add a group using square brackets[]: 
  example
  [devops]
  slave1 ansible_ssh_host=<public ip of your slave server>
> now check the connection by: ansible -m ping all.
---------------playbook---------------
now create one yaml file


 - hosts: all
   name: apache
   become: true
   become_method: sudo
   tasks:
    - name: install Apache
      apt: name=apache2 state=latest
